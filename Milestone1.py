# Milestone1.py - This is the Python code template that will be used
# for Milestone 1, demonstrating the use of PWM to fade an LED in and
# out.
#
# This code works with the test circuit that was built for Assignment 1-4.

# Load the GPIO interface from the Raspberry Pi Python Module
# The GPIO interface will be available through the GPIO object
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# Load the time module so that we can utilize the sleep method to 
# inject a pause into our operation
import time

# Setup the GPIO interface
#
# 1. Turn off warnings for now - they can be useful for debugging more
#    complex code.
# 2. Tell the GPIO library we are using Broadcom pin-numbering. The 
#    Raspberry Pi CPU is manufactured by Broadcom, and they have a 
#    specific numbering scheme for the GPIO pins. It does not match
#    the layout on the header. However, the Broadcom pin numbering is
#    what is printed on the GPIO Breakout Board, so this should match!
# 3. Tell the GPIO library that we are using GPIO line 18, and that 
#    we are using it for Output. When this state is configured, setting
#    the GPIO line to true will provide positive voltage on that pin.
#    Based on the circuit we have built, positive voltage on the GPIO
#    pin will flow through the LED, through the resistor to the ground
#    pin and the LED will light up. 
GPIO.setwarnings(False)
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# Configure a PWM instance on GPIO line 18, with a frequency of 60Hz
pwm18 = GPIO.PWM(18, 60)

# Start the PWM instance on GPIO line 18 with 0% duty cycle
pwm18.start(50)

#
# Configure the loop variable so that we can exit cleanly when the user
# issues a keyboard interrupt (CTRL-C)
#

while repeat:
    try:
        # Loop from 0 to 100 in increments of 5, updating the duty cycle.
        # This fades the LED in.
        for duty_cycle in range(0, 101, 5):
            pwm18.ChangeDutyCycle(duty_cycle)
            time.sleep(0.1)

        # Loop from 100 to 0 in decrements of 5, updating the duty cycle.
        # This fades the LED out.
        for duty_cycle in range(100, -1, -5):
            pwm18.ChangeDutyCycle(duty_cycle)
            time.sleep(0.1)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        # When the user presses Ctrl-C, stop the PWM and clean up the GPIO.
        print("KeyboardInterrupt detected. Stopping PWM and cleaning up...")
